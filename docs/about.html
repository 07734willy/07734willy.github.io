<p>This site is just a place for me to upload opinions, ideas, and explanations that are too long to keep copy/pasting into whatever platform I happen to be using. A lot of the content published here might jump around between topics wildly as I find something new to add to the collection, so don't expect there to be much correlation between individual posts. If you find something that needs correcting, feel free to raise an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/07734willy/07734willy.github.io">corresponding github repo</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to checkout the <a href="sitemap.html">article listing</a> for a complete list of all posts so far.</p></div>
